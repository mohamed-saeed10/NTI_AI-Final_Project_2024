The business objective of the Credit Score Classification project is to automate and improve the accuracy of credit risk assessments for financial institutions. By leveraging machine learning models, this system helps banks and lenders make data-driven decisions, minimize loan default risks, optimize credit approval processes, and better segment customers based on their creditworthiness. This leads to more efficient resource allocation, reduced operational costs, and improved financial planning, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and the institution's profitability while maintaining regulatory compliance.
